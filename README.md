# Hacking Course Content
Introduction

Definition of Ethical Hacking
Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization's defenses. Unlike malicious hacking, ethical hacking is performed with the organization's permission and aims to improve security.

Importance of Ethical Hacking
Ethical hacking is crucial for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers exploit them. It helps organizations protect sensitive data, maintain trust, and comply with regulatory requirements.

Legal and Ethical Considerations
Ethical hackers must operate within the boundaries of the law and obtain proper authorization before conducting tests. They should adhere to professional standards, ensuring that their actions do not harm the target environment or data.

Skills and Knowledge Required

    Strong understanding of computer systems and networks
    Proficiency in programming and scripting languages
    Knowledge of security tools and techniques
    Analytical and problem-solving skills
    Awareness of the latest security threats and vulnerabilities

    Integrity: Ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered. Techniques include hashing, checksums, and digital signatures.
    Availability: Ensures that information and resources are accessible when needed. Techniques include redundancy, failover mechanisms, and regular maintenance.

Types of Threats and Attacks

    Malware: Software designed to harm or exploit systems (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojans).
    Phishing: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.
    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Interception and alteration of communication between two parties.
    Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Overwhelming a system with traffic to make it unavailable.

Vulnerability, Exploit, and Threat Models

    Vulnerability: A weakness in a system that can be exploited by an attacker.
    Exploit: A method used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
    Threat Models: Frameworks for identifying and evaluating potential threats to a system.
